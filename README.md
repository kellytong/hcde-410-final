# hcde-410-final

My proposed project for the final is working with Airbnb listing data on housing in Seattle, Washington. I will be analyzing the housing data to explore the types of housing, details of the housing, and other aspects of Airbnb housing. This will help me gain an understanding of the prevalence of Airbnb in Seattle compared to my Airbnb experiences away from Seattle.
