# hcde-410-final

This is the final project for my HCDE 410 class - Human Data Interaction

I will be analyzing the housing data to explore how Airbnb trends change over time as the pandemic occurred and how the Airbnbs vary by different neighborhoods in Seattle. Ultimately, this will help me gain a better understanding of the prevalence of Airbnb in Seattle compared to my Airbnb experiences away from Seattle.
